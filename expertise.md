## Android
I have 8 years of developing native <i class="fab fa-android fa-lg" style="color:#78C257"/> Android apps. Android is the most [widely used operating system in the world][os-usage]. Android apps have a potential to reach a *huge* audience.


## Process
I strongly believe that good process creates quality experiences. Every project is a creative endeavor, and the process must continuously evolve to the project's unique needs. I work hard to maintain a development process that focuses on collaboratively delivering a clear vision.


## Tools
I can use a wide variety of different technologies in my development stack:
* Languages: Java, Kotlin, C++, OpenGL ES
* Architectures: MVVM, MVP, MVI
* Deployment: Play Store, Deploygate, Aptoide, Fastlane
* Development: Git, Gradle, Android Studio, Dagger / Hilt
* Testing: TDD, JUnit, Espresso, UIAutomator, Hamcrest
* Backend: JSON, YAML, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Linux, Docker
* Project Management: Gitlab, Git

## Education
I have bachelor's degrees in philosophy, psychology, and political science from the University of New Mexico, with an interdisciplinary focus on epistemology.

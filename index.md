I'm an app developer focused on creating [unique products with innovative user experiences.](projects.html) If you have a vision for an app you'd like to collaborate on, please [get in touch!](contact.html)

## Reinventing Wheels

Modern hardware has the potential to break us free from interfaces of the past. There are many opportunities to bring new life to tired old designs. We just need to put the work in.

## Execution is Everything

The quality of an app depends entirely on how it's created. I keep an Agile mentality, utilizing modern development practices to create commercial quality apps with a minimum of hassle.

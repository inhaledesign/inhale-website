## Modern Compass 2020-21

[Modern Compass][compass] is an exploration is modernizing a  tool: the magnetic compass. It contains multiple presenters, ranging from the functional (placing a compass in the Android notification bar) to the esoteric (a three dimensional compass).  

Concerted effort was made to avoid skeupmorphisms that many compass apps include.  Degree notches on a compass are imprecise and pointless on a digital interface. Modern Compass instead enables you to point your device in a direction to get a precise readout of your heading.

Modern Compass was written using test-driven development and boasts over 90% test coverage.

## Tile Farm 2014-18
*Former Co-founder and Principal Developer*

 [Tile Farm][tilefarm] is a collaboration between myself and a professional mathematician who wanted a tool for teaching math to everyone from kindergarteners to postdocs. 

 The outcome is a unique, engaging app that is particularly well suited for constructivist teaching.

 Tile Farm received incredible validation from students, teachers, school administrators, and leaders in STEM education. It went on to receive an SBIR grant from the National Science Foundation.

## Modern Compass 2020

[Modern Compass][compass] is an exploration is modernizing a  tool: the magnetic compass. It contains multiple presenters, ranging from the functional (placing a compass in the Android notification bar) to the esoteric (a three dimensional compass).  

Concerted effort was made to avoid skeupmorphisms that many compass apps include.  Degree notches on a compass are imprecise and pointless on a digital interface. Modern Compass instead enables you to point your device in a direction to get a precise readout of your heading.

Modern Compass was written using test-driven development and boasts over 90% test coverage.

## SAST Hackathon 2019

In partnership with a computer vision expert, created an app in < 20 hrs that pushed remote notifications when a security camera detected motion along the boundaries of a football field.

## Tile Farm
*Former Co-founder and Principal Android Developer 2014-18*

 [Tile Farm][tilefarm] is a collaboration between myself and a professional mathematician who wanted a tool for teaching math to everyone from kindergarteners to postdocs. 

 The outcome is an open ended app for creating incredible geometric art that is particularly well suited for constructivist teaching.

 Tile Farm has received incredible validation from students, teachers, school administrators, professors, and leaders in STEM education.
